# bug fixes and extensions

starting from version 0.11.3 of [debbuild](https://secure.deepnet.cx/trac/debbuild)
the commits of this project deal with

* handling tarballs compressed with various packers
* extracting specfiles from such tarballs
* improved handling of the %setup and %patch macros
* configuration and invocation of debbuild

some – but unfortunately not all – of these improvements have already made it back into
[the original source tree](https://secure.deepnet.cx/svn/debbuild/trunk/debbuild).
